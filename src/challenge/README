NOTE:
-----

the code used to solve the challenge problems are labelled p1-3.cc corresponding to problem 1, 2, and 3.

type "make" in the directory to build all programs, and "make distclean" to remove the programs.


Problems:
---------

p1.cc: iterate through all substrings and look for palindromes.

type "./p1" to run and the output will be printed.


p2.cc: repeatedly calling fib() will generate the Fibonacci sequence and repeatedly calling prime() will generate the sequence of prime numbers until we run out of memory (current set at 1000000 primes). 

The first part of the code finds the prime Fibonacci number, N, greater than the input. The second part of the code finds the sum of all divisors of N + 1.

type "./p2" to run and then enter the lower bound on the prime Fibonacci number.


p3.cc: iterates through all subsets while keeping track of the size of the subset and the sum of the elements.

type "./p3" to run and the answer will be printed.
